#### compresses images by resaving them
rewritten [script](https://sixey.es/program/py/files/resave.py) originally made by [musho](https://github.com/free-ghz)  
usage: open it, type the filename and the quality of the picture (inputting more than 10 is useless)

# 24098
#### turns images into [monochrome 204x96 images](https://sixey.es/20494/)
usage: open it, type the filename and choose whether the image is inverted or not (useful if the image looks bad without it)
